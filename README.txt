As the newspaper reporter looked on Rosenbaltt and his Navy cohorts fed two white cards into the machine, one marked with a small square on the left, the other marked on the right. Initially, the machine couldn't tell them apart, but after it read another fifty cards, that changed. Almost every time, it correctly identified where the card was marked--left or right. As Eosenbaltt explained it, the machine had learned this skill on its own, thanks to a mathematical system modeled on the human brain. He called it a Perceptron.
